# Awesome Info Display

<p>
Hi there :-)!

Have you ever dreamed of having your own information display, that is free of charge and fully open source?
This project - currently "work in progress" - is aiming to achieve exactly that.

Currently, this project only works on Windows, but it is planned to be used on Linux and MacOS as well.
